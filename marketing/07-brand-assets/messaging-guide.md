# Messaging Guide - WBcom Essential

Brand voice, tone guidelines, and key messages for all communications.

---

## Brand Voice

### Who We Sound Like

A knowledgeable friend who happens to be great at WordPress. Someone who:
- Explains things clearly without talking down
- Gets to the point
- Focuses on outcomes, not just features
- Admits when something has limitations
- Would rather help than sell

### Voice Characteristics

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Clear** | No jargon unless necessary | "Display your members in a grid" not "Render member entities" |
| **Direct** | Get to the point fast | Lead with the benefit, then explain |
| **Honest** | Don't overpromise | "Works well with most themes" not "Works perfectly everywhere" |
| **Helpful** | Focus on their success | "So you can..." language |
| **Confident** | Know our strengths | State benefits clearly, back with specifics |

### Voice Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Revolutionary" | Overused, meaningless | Describe what it actually does |
| "Seamless" | Vague, everyone says it | "Works together" or specific benefit |
| "Game-changing" | Hyperbolic | Show the change, don't claim it |
| "Simply" / "Just" | Minimizes complexity | Drop it entirely |
| "Leverage" | Corporate speak | "Use" |
| "Unlock" | Cliché | "Get access to" or just name the feature |
| Multiple exclamation marks | Looks desperate | One max, and sparingly |
| Excessive emojis | Unprofessional | One per piece max, or none |

---

## Tone by Context

### Marketing Website
- Confident but not pushy
- Focus on outcomes
- Use specific numbers (45 blocks, not "many blocks")
- Show, don't tell

### Documentation
- Patient and clear
- Assume competence but not expertise
- Step-by-step when needed
- Acknowledge when something's complex

### Support
- Empathetic first
- Solution-focused
- Admit if we don't know
- Follow up

### Social Media
- Conversational
- Brief and scannable
- Value-forward (teach something)
- Human, not corporate

---

### Quality Check Questions

Before publishing any content:
1. Would I say this to a friend?
2. Is this specific or vague?
3. Does it help the reader?
4. Could a competitor say the same thing?
5. Is there a simpler way to say this?
