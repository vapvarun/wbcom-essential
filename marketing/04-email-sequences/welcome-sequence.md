Hey [Name],

Since you're building a BuddyPress site, here are the 11 blocks you'll want to know about:

**For displaying members:**
- Members Grid - Responsive grid with profile data
- Members Carousel - Sliding member showcase
- Members Lists - Compact list format

**For groups:**
- Groups Grid - Show community groups
- Group Carousel - Groups in carousel
- Groups Lists - List format for groups

**For engagement:**
- Profile Completion - Encourages users to fill out profiles
- Dashboard Intro - Welcome section for logged-in members
- Forums & Forums Activity - Display bbPress content

**Quick tip:** Add the Members Grid block to your homepage. When visitors see an active community, they're more likely to join.

## Email 3: Theme Colors Deep Dive

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject Line Options:**
- A) The feature that saves hours of styling
- B) Stop picking colors manually
- C) Your theme's colors, applied automatically

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [Name],

Quick tip that saves a lot of time: the Theme Colors toggle.

**How it works:**
1. Add any WBcom Essential block
2. Find "Use Theme Colors" in settings
3. Toggle it ON

The block now uses your theme's color palette. Change your theme colors, and blocks update automatically.

**Why it matters:**
Without this, you'd pick primary color, secondary color, text color, and background for every block. With 20 blocks on a page, that's 80+ color decisions.

Theme Colors: Zero color decisions. Everything matches.

**Works best with:**
- Theme Reign (full integration)
- BuddyX theme (full integration)
- BuddyX Pro (full integration)
- Any theme using CSS custom properties

**For other themes:**
Blocks use sensible defaults, and you can still customize colors manually if needed.

Try it on a page with multiple blocks—you'll see the difference immediately.

## Email 6: Theme Recommendation

**Subject Line Options:**
- A) Get the most from WBcom Essential
- B) The themes we built it for
- C) Full color integration with these themes

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [Name],

Quick note about getting the most from WBcom Essential.

We built this plugin as a companion for our themes. If you're using Theme Reign, BuddyX, or BuddyX Pro, you already have full integration—Theme Colors matches automatically, and everything's tested together.

**If you're using another theme:**
WBcom Essential works with any theme, but you might need to set colors manually. That's fine—the blocks are fully customizable.

**If you're in the market for a theme:**
Here's what we make:

**Theme Reign** - Premium WordPress theme with excellent BuddyPress support

**BuddyX** - Free theme from WordPress.org. Great for community sites. Full WBcom Essential integration.

**BuddyX Pro** - Premium version of BuddyX with additional features and priority support.

No pressure to switch—just wanted you to know these options exist if you're looking.
