## Featured Testimonials

### Testimonial 1: Cost Savings

**— Sarah M., Community Manager**

**Use For:** Landing page, pricing discussions, objection handling

---

### Testimonial 2: Time Savings

**— Marcus T., Agency Developer**

**Use For:** Developer/agency targeting, ROI discussions

---

**— Jennifer L., Nonprofit Director**

**Use For:** Non-technical users, ease of use messaging

**— David K., Online Course Creator**

**Use For:** BuddyPress users, plugin comparison discussions

**Use For:** Performance concerns, technical users

## Video Testimonial Script Templates

### Short (15-30 seconds)
> "Hi, I'm [Name], and I run a BuddyPress community. Before Wbcom Essential, building member pages took hours. Now? I drag in a widget, customize the colors, and I'm done. It's free, it works with my BuddyX theme, and it saved me hundreds of dollars."

### Medium (60 seconds)
> "I'm [Name], and I build community websites for clients.
>
> My biggest challenge was always the BuddyPress layouts — they look generic out of the box, and custom development is expensive.
>
> When I found Wbcom Essential, everything changed. 43 Elementor widgets, 38 Gutenberg blocks, and 11 of them are specifically for BuddyPress.
>
> Now I can add member grids, group carousels, forum feeds — all with drag and drop. My clients think I spent hours on custom development. I didn't.
>
> Oh, and it's free. Made by the same team that built the BuddyX theme. If you're using BuddyX or Reign, just install it. You'll wonder why you didn't find it sooner."
