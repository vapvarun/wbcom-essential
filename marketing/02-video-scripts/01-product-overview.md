## Script

### INTRO (0:00 - 0:15)

**VISUAL:** WBcom Essential plugin page or logo animation

**NARRATOR:**
"Building a WordPress site and tired of generic blocks that don't match your theme? Let me show you WBcom Essential—45 Gutenberg blocks and 43 Elementor widgets that actually work together."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "WBcom Essential - 45 Blocks. 43 Widgets."

---

### PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:35)

**VISUAL:** Generic WordPress site with mismatched styling

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's the usual problem. You find a block plugin, add a testimonial carousel, and it looks completely different from your site. Then you spend an hour picking colors, adjusting fonts, trying to make it fit."

**VISUAL:** Someone clicking through color pickers repeatedly

**NARRATOR:**
"And if you're building a BuddyPress community site? Most block plugins completely ignore that. You're stuck with default BuddyPress layouts that look... basic."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "Sound familiar?"

---

### SOLUTION - THEME COLORS (0:35 - 1:00)

**VISUAL:** Adding a WBcom Essential block, toggling Theme Colors

**NARRATOR:**
"WBcom Essential solves this with one toggle. Add any block, find 'Use Theme Colors' in the settings, turn it on. Done. The block matches your theme automatically."

**VISUAL:** Side-by-side showing before/after Theme Colors toggle

**NARRATOR:**
"No more color picking. No more font matching. Your theme's design system applies automatically."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "Theme Colors - Automatic matching"

---

### SOLUTION - BLOCKS OVERVIEW (1:00 - 1:30)

**VISUAL:** Quick montage of different blocks being added

**NARRATOR:**
"The plugin includes 45 blocks covering everything you'd actually use. Sliders, carousels, testimonials, pricing tables, accordions, timelines, team sections..."

**VISUAL:** BuddyPress blocks being shown

**NARRATOR:**
"And 11 blocks built specifically for BuddyPress. Member grids, group carousels, profile completion widgets. These understand BuddyPress data—they're not adapted generic blocks."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "11 BuddyPress Blocks"

**VISUAL:** Elementor editor showing widgets

**NARRATOR:**
"Prefer Elementor? Same features are available as 43 Elementor widgets. Use whichever editor you like."

---

### DEMO (1:30 - 2:00)

**VISUAL:** Live demo adding Members Grid to a page

**NARRATOR:**
"Let me show you how quick this is. I'll add a Members Grid to this homepage."

**VISUAL:** Search for block, add it, enable Theme Colors

**NARRATOR:**
"Search 'Members Grid', add it to the page, enable Theme Colors, and adjust the columns. That's it. Professional member directory in about 30 seconds."

**VISUAL:** Preview of the finished page

**NARRATOR:**
"No custom queries, no CSS, no hiring a developer. Just blocks that work."

---

### CALL TO ACTION (2:00 - 2:15)

**VISUAL:** Plugin download page

**NARRATOR:**
"WBcom Essential is completely free—all 45 blocks, all 43 widgets included. Download it, try it on your site, and see the difference."

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "Free download - wbcomdesigns.com/downloads/wbcom-essential"

**NARRATOR:**

## Production Notes

### Screen Recording Tips
- Use a clean WordPress install
- Pre-populate with realistic content (not "Test Post 1")
- Use BuddyX theme or a well-styled theme for best visuals
- Record at 1920x1080 or higher
- Mouse movements should be deliberate, not rushed

### Voice Recording Tips
- Natural conversational tone
- Avoid marketing-speak
- Pause slightly between sections
- Don't rush—clarity over speed

### Editing Notes
- Cut dead space but don't make it feel rushed
- Add subtle zoom on important UI elements
- Use transitions sparingly
- Add lower-thirds for key features
- Include progress bar or chapter markers

### Music Suggestions
- Upbeat but not overwhelming
- Instrumental only
- Fade out during narration peaks
- Artlist or Epidemic Sound libraries work well

### Thumbnail Elements
- WBcom Essential logo
- "45 Blocks" prominently displayed
- WordPress editor in background
- Clean, readable text
