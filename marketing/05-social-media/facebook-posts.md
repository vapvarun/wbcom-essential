## Product Announcement

### Launch Post

Hey WordPress community!

We're excited to share WBcom Essential—a companion plugin we've been building for WordPress and BuddyPress sites.

**What's in it:**
- 45 Gutenberg blocks
- 43 Elementor widgets
- 11 blocks made specifically for BuddyPress

**Why we built it:**
If you've ever tried to make a BuddyPress site look professional, you know the struggle. The default layouts are... basic. And most block plugins completely ignore community features.

So we built blocks that actually understand BuddyPress—member grids, group carousels, profile completion widgets, and more.

**Best part:**
The "Theme Colors" toggle lets blocks automatically match your theme. No more picking the same shade of blue over and over.

It's completely free—all 45 blocks and 43 widgets included. Would love to hear what you think!

## Tips Posts

### Quick Tip: Theme Colors

**Quick tip for WBcom Essential users:**

Before you spend time customizing colors, try this:

1. Select any block
2. Find "Use Theme Colors" in the settings
3. Toggle it ON

The block will automatically use your theme's colors. If you're using Theme Reign, BuddyX, or BuddyX Pro, it integrates perfectly. Works with any theme that uses CSS variables too.

Saves a ton of time on color matching!

### Quick Tip: BuddyPress

**BuddyPress tip:**

If your members aren't completing their profiles, add the Profile Completion block to their dashboard.

It shows a progress bar and links to missing fields. Visual reminder = more complete profiles = better community.

Find it under Starter Pack - BuddyPress in the block inserter.

---

### Quick Tip: Sliders

**Not sure which slider block to use?**

Quick guide:

- **Post Carousel** - One post at a time, slideshow style
- **Posts Carousel** - Multiple posts visible, group scrolling
- **Post Slider** - Full-width, hero-style with image backgrounds
- **Slider** - Custom content slides (not posts)

Pick based on how much focus each item needs.

Sometimes the boring wins are the best wins.

Turns out people fill in forms when you show them a progress bar.

Psychology works.
