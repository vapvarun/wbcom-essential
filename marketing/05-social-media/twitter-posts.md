## Short Tips (Under 200 chars)

Tip: Turn on "Theme Colors" before customizing anything else. Half the styling work is done automatically.

---

Tip: Members Carousel works great in sidebars. Add it to a widget area for "Featured Members" displays.

---

Tip: Countdown block for sale pages. Set the end date, add urgency without fake scarcity tactics.

---

Tip: Profile Completion block on member dashboards. Users complete more profile fields when they see progress.

## Quote/Insight Posts

"The best interface is no interface."
— Golden Krishna

Theme Colors toggle exists because you shouldn't have to pick the same blue 47 times.

---

Most block plugins give you 200 blocks.

You use maybe 15.

WBcom Essential: 45 blocks you'll actually use.
Quality over quantity.
