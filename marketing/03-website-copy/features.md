**Everything You Need to Build Professional WordPress Sites**

## Page Intro
45 Gutenberg blocks. 43 Elementor widgets. Theme colors that match automatically. Here's what WBcom Essential gives you.

## Feature: Theme Colors Toggle

### Headline
**Match Your Theme Without Picking Colors**

### Description
Every block includes a "Use Theme Colors" toggle. Enable it, and the block inherits your theme's color palette through CSS custom properties.

### How It Works
1. Add any block to your page
2. Open the block settings
3. Toggle "Use Theme Colors" on
4. The block matches your theme instantly

### Why It Matters
Stop spending time on color coordination. The block reads your theme's CSS variables and applies them automatically. Change your theme colors, and blocks update to match.

### Technical Details
- Uses CSS custom properties for color inheritance
- Works with themes that define color variables
- Provides fallback colors for themes without variables
- BuddyX theme fully supported with complete color mapping
