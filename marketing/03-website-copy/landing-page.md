## Problem Section

### Section Headline
**Great Theme. Now You Need Great Blocks.**

### Problem Points

**Generic blocks look generic.**
You add a testimonial carousel, and it looks nothing like your site. Then you spend an hour adjusting colors, fonts, and spacing just to make it fit.

**BuddyPress layouts need work.**
Out-of-the-box BuddyPress looks dated. You want member grids, group carousels, and profile widgets that look like they belong on a modern website.

**Too many plugins for basic features.**
One plugin for sliders. Another for pricing tables. A third for testimonials. Your site slows down, conflicts appear, and updates become a headache.

**Elementor OR Gutenberg, not both.**
Some pages work better with Elementor. Others with Gutenberg. You end up maintaining different solutions for different needs.

## BuddyPress Section

### Section Headline
**Built for BuddyPress. Actually.**

### Section Copy
Most block plugins ignore BuddyPress. We built 11 blocks specifically for community sites because that's what we do—our team created BuddyX theme and we understand community sites.

These aren't generic blocks adapted for BuddyPress. They're built to understand member data, group information, and community activity from the ground up.

### BuddyPress Features List

**Members Grid**
Display community members in a customizable grid. Filter by member type, show profile fields, link to profiles.

**Members Carousel**
Smooth carousel of member avatars. Great for "Featured Members" sections.

**Groups Grid & Carousel**
Show public groups with member counts, descriptions, and join buttons.

**Profile Completion**
Encourage users to complete their profiles with a visual progress indicator.

**Forums & Activity**
Display bbPress forums and recent activity feeds anywhere on your site.

**Dashboard Intro**
Welcome section for logged-in members with quick links to common actions.

### BuddyPress CTA
**Works with BuddyPress 10.0+ and bbPress 2.6+**

---

## Theme Colors Section

### Section Headline
**Stop Picking Colors. Let the Block Match Your Theme.**

### Section Copy
Every block includes a "Use Theme Colors" toggle. Enable it, and the block inherits your theme's color palette through CSS custom properties.

Works best with Theme Reign, BuddyX, and BuddyX Pro themes—but provides sensible defaults for any theme.

### Before/After Concept

**Before:** Add block → Pick primary color → Pick secondary color → Pick text color → Pick background → Adjust, adjust, adjust

**After:** Add block → Enable Theme Colors → Done

---

## Dual Editor Section

### Section Headline
**Gutenberg User? Elementor Fan? Both Work.**

### Section Copy
Some pages work better with Gutenberg's native feel. Others benefit from Elementor's drag-and-drop interface. With WBcom Essential, you don't have to choose—or maintain two different plugins.

**45 Gutenberg Blocks**
Native WordPress blocks built with React. Clean code, fast loading, works with Full Site Editing.

**43 Elementor Widgets**
All the same features in Elementor widget format. Use Elementor's familiar interface with our components.

**Same Features, Both Editors**
Members Grid in Gutenberg. Members Grid in Elementor. Same functionality, your preferred editor.
