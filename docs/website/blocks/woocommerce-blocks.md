Why Only 2 WooCommerce Blocks?

WooCommerce itself provides excellent native blocks for:

Product details
Product reviews
Cart and checkout
Account pages

We focused on blocks that enhance WooCommerce where native blocks don't exist:

Product Grid - More styling control than native WC blocks
Mini Cart - Header integration with dropdown preview
