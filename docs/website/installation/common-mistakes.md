Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

Learn from these common mistakes to build better sites faster!

Mistake #1: Not Using Theme Colors

The Problem

Manually setting colors on every block, then needing to change your brand color and having to update 50+ blocks.

The Solution

Enable "Use Theme Colors" on every block
Set your colors once in Appearance > Customize > Colors
All blocks automatically update when you change theme colors

How to Enable

Every WBcom Essential block has a "Use Theme Colors" toggle in the Color Settings panel:

Block Settings &gt; Color Settings &gt; Use Theme Colors: ON

Time Saved: Hours of manual color updates when rebranding

Mistake #2: Too Many Carousel Items

The Problem

Adding 30+ items to a carousel, causing slow page load and poor performance.

The Solution

Block TypeRecommended MaxMembers Carousel12Groups Carousel12Posts Carousel8Testimonials6Team Carousel8

Why It Matters

Each item loads images and data
Mobile users on slow connections suffer most
Google penalizes slow sites in search rankings

Better Alternative

Use pagination or "Load More" buttons for large collections instead of cramming everything into one carousel.

Mistake #3: Forgetting to Enable Loop

The Problem

Carousel stops at the end, leaving visitors confused about how to see more items.

The Solution

Always enable Loop in carousel settings:

Block Settings &gt; Carousel Settings &gt; Loop: ON

This creates infinite scrolling where the carousel continues smoothly.

Also Enable

Autoplay: Keeps carousel moving automatically
Pause on Hover: Stops when user hovers (shows they have control)

Mistake #4: Ignoring Mobile Preview

The Problem

Building beautiful desktop layouts that look terrible on phones.

The Solution

Always preview on mobile before publishing:

Click "Preview" in the editor
Use browser DevTools (F12) > Toggle Device Toolbar
Check at 375px width (iPhone size)

What to Check

[ ] Text is readable without zooming
[ ] Buttons are tappable (not too small)
[ ] Carousels swipe smoothly
[ ] No horizontal scrolling
[ ] Images don't overflow

Mistake #5: Wrong Block for the Job

The Problem

Using Members Grid when you wanted Members Carousel, or vice versa.

The Solution

Want ThisUse ThisSliding showcaseCarousel blocksFull directory pageGrid blocksCompact, detailed listLists blocks

Quick Reference

Carousel = Moving, engaging, limited items
Grid = Static, filterable, many items
List = Compact, detailed info, easy scanning

Mistake #6: No Call-to-Action

The Problem

Beautiful pages that don't tell visitors what to do next.

The Solution

Every important page needs a clear CTA:

[CTA Box]
Title: &quot;Ready to Get Started?&quot;
Button: &quot;Sign Up Free&quot; or &quot;Contact Us&quot;

CTA Placement Tips

End of homepage sections: Keep visitors engaged
After testimonials: Social proof leads to action
Below pricing tables: Make it easy to buy
In the header: Always visible option

Mistake #7: Inconsistent Styling

The Problem

Each block has different colors, fonts, and spacing, making the site look unprofessional.

The Solution

Use Theme Colors toggle (mentioned above)
Stick to 2-3 colors (primary, secondary, accent)
Use consistent spacing (30px between sections is standard)
Match your theme (BuddyX, BuddyX Pro, or Reign)

Quick Consistency Check

[ ] All headings use the same style
[ ] Button colors match across blocks
[ ] Spacing between sections is even
[ ] Fonts are consistent

Mistake #8: Slow Images

The Problem

Uploading huge images (5MB+) that slow down your site.

The Solution

Before uploading images:

Resize: Max 1920px wide for full-width, 800px for content
Compress: Use TinyPNG or ShortPixel
Format: Use WebP when possible

Recommended Sizes

Mistake #9: Not Testing with Real Content

The Problem

Using placeholder text and images, then the design breaks with real content.

The Solution

Test with realistic content:

Names: Use real-length names (not just "John")
Testimonials: Use full quotes (not "Great!")
Posts: Use actual post titles and excerpts
Products: Use real product data

What Breaks with Real Content

Long names overflow cards
Short testimonials look empty
Product titles wrap awkwardly
Images have wrong aspect ratios

Mistake #10: Forgetting BuddyPress/WooCommerce Activation

The Problem

"Why don't I see the Members Grid block?"

The Solution

BuddyPress and WooCommerce blocks only appear when those plugins are active:

PluginBlocks Available When ActiveBuddyPressMembers, Groups, Forums, Dashboard Intro, Profile Completion, Header BarWooCommerceProduct Grid, Mini Cart, Header Bar (cart)

Checklist

Install and activate BuddyPress/WooCommerce
Enable required components (Settings > BuddyPress)
Refresh the editor
Blocks now appear

Mistake #11: Overloading the Homepage

The Problem

Every block on the homepage: Members Carousel + Groups Grid + Posts Carousel + Products + Testimonials + Forum Activity + Countdown + CTA...

The Solution

Homepage should be focused, not exhaustive:

Recommended Homepage Structure:

Hero section (Slider or large image)
Brief intro (what your site is about)
1-2 content showcases (Members OR Products)
Social proof (Testimonials)
Clear CTA

Move to other pages:

Full member directory → Members page
All products → Shop page
Forum activity → Community page

Mistake #12: Ignoring Performance

The Problem

Site takes 10+ seconds to load because of too many heavy elements.

The Solution

Follow these performance guidelines:

ElementMaximum Per PageCarousels2-3Grids1-2 (with pagination)Videos1 (lazy load)Large images5-6
